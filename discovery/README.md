# `Discovery`

Discover the world of microcontrollers through [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)!

There are currently two versions of this book. Both of them provide an
introduction to microcontrollers and how to use Rust with them.
The first is older and uses an F3 Discovery circuit board, while
the second is newer and uses a micro:bit circuit board instead.

- Read the newer book, using a micro:bit:
  https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit
- Read the older book, using an F3 discovery board:
  https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/f3discovery
- Start working on the examples from this repository

- Have fun and enjoy!
